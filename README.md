	In this notebook we use the VGG16 deep convolutional neural netwrok model (initialized with the pretrained weights) to 
classify 2582 images of birds taken from 10 different bird species. We also test the model on 300 images of the 10 classes. 
We use GPUs for training the network and get very good accuracy (better than 86% for all bird species; best accuracy ~99% 
for two bird species).
